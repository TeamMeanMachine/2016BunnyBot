# BunnyBots 2016

## Structure

This repository contains the code for Alpha* and Omega*.

The code for each robot is seperated in their respective directories.
Both of these directories contain gradle projects which are independant of each other.

*\* name pending*

## Tools

Almost all of the code will be written using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

New programmers will also need a git client. For beginners, we recommend the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app.

## Building

Both projects can be built or deployed by using the gradle wrapper's `build` and `deploy` tasks respectively. This may be done by using the command line
or by adding the task to IntelliJ.

## Branching and Merging

Robot features should be separated into their own branches. Examples of features include new commands, new subsystems, or bug fixes.

After a feature is finished and tested, a pull request should be created, and the pull request must receive at least one review to be merged.

Committing robot code directly to master should be avoided in general.
