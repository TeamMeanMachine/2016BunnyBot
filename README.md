# BunnyBots 2016

## Structure

This repository contains the code for both of our robots we made for BunnyBots 2016.

The code for each robot is seperated in their respective directories.
Both of these directories contain gradle projects which are independant of each other, and are meant to be opened as seperate projects.

The code for Speedy (2471A) can be found in the Omega directory, and the code for Thunder McBoomstix (2471B) can be found in the Delta
directory. 

## Tools

Almost all of the code will be written using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

New programmers will also need a git client. For beginners, we recommend the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) app,
or IntelliJ IDEA's git plugin.

## Building

Both projects can be built or deployed by using the gradle wrapper's `build` and `deploy` tasks respectively. This may be done by using the command line
or by adding the task to IntelliJ.
